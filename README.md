The first step of the creation process is going to portal.azure.com to make the subscription. You'll need to make a username and password. You'll also have to have a credit card. For a first time user, you'll have access to $200 worth of free credits to use. Once your account/subscription is created, it's time to begin.

<p>
The second step is to name your resource group. For my example, I named mines TG-Lab-1. Once named, you'll also have to make two underset names. I chose Creator for the first and TJ for the second. Then you'll hit Create. It will take a few seconds or a while for your Resource Group to be created.

</p>This is what you're Resource Group will look like once created in Microsoft Azure. Once your Resource Group is created, then you're ready to create a Virtual Machine inside your Resource Group.

<p>
Inside the search bar, you'll type Virtual Machine. From there, you'll hit the Create Virtual Machine button at the top. Once selected, you'll want to name your Virtual Machine. For my example, I named my Virtual Machine VM1. You'll also want to select to run this in Windows 10. Afterwards, you'll need to make a username and password to continue. You'll finally move along through the prompts until you create your Virtual Machine. You must now wait until the validation is complete.

Finally once your Virtual Machine is created, you'll be able to see your process in the Resource Group that you created. There will be 5 resources that are created within the Virtual Machine.
